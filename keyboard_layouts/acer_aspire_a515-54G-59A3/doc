This was done by first getting the .xkb configuration with the command
	kbcomp $DISPLAY original.xkb

Then copying it so it is not lost (even though it should be  recovered on reboot)

Then changing the keycodes. This made it work as intended.
Keycodes were gathered with "xev". Just check which keycodes are different
on your "functioning" keyboard and what the key should be on your "non-functioning" keyboard.

Then the layout is switched with:
	xkbcomp new_layout.xkb $DISPLAY	

Added 2 aliases to easily switch between them.


macintoshA1644_cmmnd.xkb changed "Left Command" key to be a "Left Control" key.
	Left Control does nothing.

To disable Menu Launcher on Super_L (left command) insert kwinrc into ~/.config/
